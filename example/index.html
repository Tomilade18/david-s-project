        <h3>Standard Terms</h3>
        <p>Customer, by participating in the Net-Zero Energy Management ('NEM') study of Energhx Green Energy Corporation ('Energhx'), accepts Energhx as its exclusive 												
            supplier of electricity and natural gas for a five year term ('Term'), beginning on the date shown above. Customer has read this Agreement, read the disclosure 												
            statement approved by the Ontario Energy Board and attached as Attachment 1, and read the price comparison attached as Attachment 2. This Agreement, 												
            together with its two Attachments comprises the entire agreement between the two parties.</p>
        
            <p>You will continue to be supplied with electricity and natural gas whether or not you sign this Agreement. You may cancel this Agreement with full restore or												
            refund entitlement within 10 days of signing this Agreement. Unless you have cancelled, an Associate will call you within 10 to 45 days after you have signed it, to 												
            verify that you want to confirm the contract in order to proceed with the review of your appliance and building envelope audit. If at that time you do not indicate 												
            that you want to confirm the contract, it will become invalid, without any cancellation fee to you, and your supply of electricity and natural gas will not be 												
            interrupted. If you confirm the contract, you will receive your electricity and natural gas exclusively from Energhx, and Energhx will enroll your electricity and 												
            natural gas accounts with your local distribution company ('LDC').</p>
        
            <p>Depending on the operational cycle of your LDC, transfer to Energhx is expected to occur within 60 to 90 days from the validation of this Agreement ('Audit												
            Period'). A cancellation fee of $100 is mandatory after the Audit Period, if you decide to exit this Agreement before the end of the Term. However, you may also												
            cancel the Agreement without cost or penalty: (1) up to 30 days after receiving the second DSM audit report under this Agreement; or 60 days after the signing of 												
            this Contract, whichever is later; (2) if Energhx fails to provide you with an electronic copy of this Contract within 10 days of your request for a copy; (3) if Energhx 												
            is not complaince with the conditions of its licence set out in sections 3 and 4 of the Ontario Regulation 90/99 (Licence Requirements - Electricity Retailers and 												
            Gas Marketers) made under the Ontario Energy Board Act, 1998; and (4) if this Agreemnt was entered into for a term that begins before the expiry of the term of a 												
            pre-existing contract, but only if notice of the cancellation is provided before the end of the term of the pre-exisiting contract.</p>
        
            <p>If you realise that the NEM study is not beneficial to you and/or the setup of your energy system, you may withdraw from this study program at anytime 												
            throughout the period of this Agreement. This withdrawal will not result in any avoidable interruption of your electricity and natural gas supply, either through 												
            Energhx or your LDC, depending on your choice. Furthermore, nothing under this Agreement negates or varies your right to cancel this Agreement under and in 												
            accordance with the Energy Consumer Protection Act, 2010, without cost or penalty.</p>
       
            <p>If you move permanently out of your present address, you may arrange the re-assignment of the contract to a new tenant or transfer to your new account in 												
            another location, where Energhx has service agreement with the new Utility. However, under any such assignment, any benefit that may be due to be credited to 												
            your account under this Agreement will be received by the assignee and not to you, and likewise any rebate provided by your LDC ir by the Province of Ontario.												
            If you have any complaint about our service or billing, or wish to request additionial information or to renew this Agreement, you may contact Energhx through 												
            Contact Us' link on your account dashboard. If there is any need for cancellation of this Agreement, a notice of cancellation should be sent electronically 												
            through your account dashboard.</p>
        
            <p>You will continue to receive a detailed account statement periodically from your LDC. This account must be paid within 30 days of its receipt by you. If the account 												
            is not paid within 30 days, interest will be applied to the account at the rate of 5% per month. If the account remains unpaid for 3 consecutive months, Energhx 												
            may discontinue its supply to you after arranging for transfer of your service to your LDC. A statement that is mailed to you will be deemed to have been received 												
            by you within 10 days of the mailing date.</p>
        
            <p>This Agreement may be amended, renewed for a further term of 5 years, or extended for an additional 5 years by mutual agreement request from your account 												
            dashboard. In the absence of any renewal or extension being agreed to 14 days prior to the end of the five-year term of this Agreement, the Agreement will end 												
            at the end of the five-year term and Customer will be responsible for either transferring its supply to another service provider or to its local distribution company.</p>

            appliance and building envelope audit. However, customer who upgrade to either the Standard or Premium Plan acknowledges and accepts all Net-Zero Energy 												
            Management Charge Terms forming part of this Agreement. Net-Zero Energy Management involves different components, including (1) Solar PV Sizing and

            secured, as arranged by Energhx' independent Server or Developer.												
            Without executing a separate Contract Amendment, where the detail of your participation in the Net-Zero Energy Management project and the cost are specified, 												
            this Agreement does not authorize the inclusion of Net-Zero Energy Management Charge.												
            However, the Customer accepts a guaranteed free and no-obligation Net-Zero Energy Management, of the type and scope as determined by Energhx, up to the 												
            date of the release of the second energy audit report.</p>

            <h3>Electricity and Natural Gas Commodity Charge Terms</h3>

                Charge or Gas Commodity Charge ('Charge'). This Charge will be calculated based on your usage of electricity and natural gas at Market Price throughout the Term 												
                of this Agreement. This amount does not include all the applicable regulatory charges, as specified in Attachment 1 of this Agreement.												
                The Market Price of any Electricity Commodity Charge and Gas Commodity Charge will be determined by the following:

            calculation, we may in our sole  discretion either terminate this Agreement or
